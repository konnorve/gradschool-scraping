Alan J. Grodzinsky,"Our group focuses on problems motivated by diseases of the musculoskeletal system including arthritis, connective tissue pathologies and, more generally, the molecular biology and biophysics of the extracellular matrix (ECM). As an example, it is well known that traumatic joint injury in humans causes cartilage degeneration and progression to post-traumatic osteoarthritis, but the mechanobiological mechanisms governing cellular transcription, translation, and post-translational responses to physical overload are not well understood. We use genomic and proteomic tools to identify key pathways associated with mechanical injury and the resulting cell-mediated proteolytic degradation of the ECM. Atomic force microscopy and related biophysical tools are used to image and probe the molecular structure of ECM proteoglycans and proteins synthesized by connective tissue cells in health and disease. Nanoindentation at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels aids in the discovery of molecular determinants underlying tissue pathology. Complementary projects focus on chondrogenesis of stem cells seeded within self-assembling peptide hydrogel scaffolds for repair of degraded or osteoarthritic cartilage. The molecular fine structure of stem cell-synthesized ECM molecules and the responses of these stem cells to physiological loading during and after differentiation are studied . . Concurrent studies using small and large animal models are ongoing. Finally, there are currently no available disease-modifying drugs for osteoarthritis due, in part, to lack of appropriate delivery modalities. We are therefore studying the ability of electrostatic interactions linked to charged ECM molecules within target tissues to enable enhanced uptake, rapid penetration, and retention of potential therapeutics.",https://be.mit.edu/directory/alan-j-grodzinsky,Biological Engineering (BE),MIT BioEngineering,http://continuumlab.mit.edu,alg@mit.edu

K. Dane Wittrup,"Engineers now have the tools to design biological products and processes at the molecular level. Proteins are of particular therapeutic interest, because proteins mediate most biochemical processes both inside and outside cells. The ability to manipulate the strength and specificity of protein binding events provides tremendous leverage for the development of novel biopharmaceuticals. The Wittrup laboratory is developing powerful new tools for protein engineering, and applying them both to particular disease targets and to bettering our understanding of protein structure/function relationships. In the absence of predictive capabilities for protein design, a directed evolution or combinatorial library screening strategy can be effectively applied to alter protein properties in a desired fashion. The group is applying quantitative engineering analyses of the relevant kinetic and statistical processes to develop optimal search strategies on the protein fitness landscape. In particular, the lab has developed a method for protein display on the surface of yeast cells that, for example, enabled engineering of a noncovalent protein-ligand bond with a dissociation half-time over one week. The group is engineering potential protein biopharmaceuticals in areas where molecular understanding of disease pathology is sufficient to hypothesize particular objective functions to target. For example, antibodies can be used to target cell-killing modalities to cancerous cells, given sufficiently strong and specific binding properties. Growth factors that carry signals between cells do so via particular binding events that, if manipulated to alter intracellular trafficking or signalling outcomes, could alter immune responses in precisely defined ways. Finally, viral and nonviral vectors for gene therapy could be targeted to specific cells and tissues via alteration of an exchangeable antibody recognition module. Altered proteins developed in this work can also provide a potential vehicle for new insights into the mechanisms of protein-ligand binding.

Ongoing work is aimed at understanding how higher-order receptor clustering is initiated, how the composition of clusters is regulated, and how the chemical and material properties of a cluster controls the activities of signaling molecules.

A major goal of neuroscience is to understand how neural circuits generate coherent behavioral outputs across such a wide range of time scales. Long-lasting behavioral states—including arousal states (sleep, wake) and complex internal states (emotions)—are thought to be controlled by biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators. However, we still have a poor understanding of the basic neural mechanisms that underlie behavioral state initiation, maintenance and termination.

Mary Gehring,"Understanding the extent of information transmission from one generation to the next is a fundamental biological question. The mechanisms and importance of genetic information transmission have been elucidated over the past 100 years. The existence, extent, and consequences of other types of non-genetic inherited information are comparatively little understood, as is the evolutionary impact, if any, of such information transfer. Potential forms of non-genetic inherited information, often referred to as epigenetic, include patterns of modifications to DNA and chromatin, RNA molecules, and proteins with alternative, self-perpetuating structures. The goal of my research program is to dissect how dynamic changes to the epigenome impact genome function and plant growth and development. To this end, my lab is focused on understanding 1) how DNA methylation stability is maintained on cellular and generational timescales and 2) the nature of epigenetic reprogramming and genetic conflicts during reproduction. Specifically, we are addressing the dynamics of DNA methylation and demethylation at the cellular scale, investigating whether faithful epigenetic inheritance is dependent on particular cell types or passage through meiosis, identifying the mechanisms of imprinting and function of imprinted genes in seeds, determining how seed small RNAs regulate both imprinted expression and global genome dosage, and investigating how transposable elements expressed as a result of epigenomic reprogramming in seeds interact with and impact the host. Our primary research organism, with its unmatched tools, resources, and tractability, is the model plant . , but we frequently incorporate other plant species when it best suits our research questions.

Our group has a very productive interdisciplinary collaboration with leading biologists that has allowed us to tackle extraordinarily difficult and interesting problems that underlie cellular function and development. Current work in our laboratory is examining how we can computationally model chromatin modifying complexes that are associated with the genome of living yeast cells. New kinds of mechanistic computational models are necessary to capture how chromatin structure encodes cellular memory, and how the state of this memory is used to control gene expression. In particular, we are investigating new modular graphical models that use mechanistic constraints to describe biological mechanism. A new focus is an interdisciplinary project that seeks to build computational models of the transcriptional regulatory networks that control the differentiation of specific cell types. Elucidating these regulatory networks will enable us to define the regulatory processes that determine a cell's progress to its terminally differentiated state, and position us to differentiate embryonic stem (ES) cells for the treatment of debilitating human diseases.

Manolis Kellis,"Perhaps the greatest surprise of human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that 90% of disease-associated regions do not affect proteins directly, but instead lie in non-coding regions with putative gene-regulatory roles. This has increased the urgency of understanding the non-coding genome, as a key component of understanding human disease. To address this challenge, we generated maps of genomic control elements across 127 primary human tissues and cell types, and tissue-specific regulatory networks linking these elements to their target genes and their regulators. We have used these maps and circuits to understand how human genetic variation contributes to disease and cancer, providing an unbiased view of disease genetics and sometimes re-shaping our understanding of common disorders. For example, we find evidence that genetic variants contributing to Alzheimer’s disease act primarily through immune processes, rather than neuronal processes. We also find that the strongest genetic association with obesity acts via a master switch controlling energy storage vs. energy dissipation in our adipocytes, rather than through the control of appetite in the brain. We also combine genetic information with regulatory annotations and epigenomic variation across patients and healthy controls to discover new disease genes and regions with roles in Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and prostate cancer. Lastly, we manipulate these circuits by genome editing and gene targeting in human cells and in mice, demonstrating tissue-autonomous therapeutic avenues in Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, and cancer.

We use ‘simple’ bacterial cells to discover quantitative principles governing gene expression. We invent new tools that provide key missing observables, coupled with the development of analytical frameworks enabled by these new observables. Ultimately, we want to understand how cells work as an optimization process through evolution. To achieve this objective, my lab is developing methods to directly answer the following questions: 1) .  My lab is developing several high-resolution methods to define the post-transcriptional processes that determine the rates of protein synthesis. We are establishing a single-molecule approach to profile the kinetics of ribosome initiation in living cells. We are also creating a new RNA-seq approach for mapping mRNA processing sites and quantifying isoform abundance in bacteria. Our goal is to build a predictive model for these key determinants that will help advance studies in both basic and synthetic biology. 2) .  Cells tightly regulate their protein expression, but we have no means of rationalizing the observed levels for most proteins. Traditional studies of cellular pathways and processes have largely omitted information on absolute protein abundance, even though it is one of the key outcomes of gene regulation. My lab is developing theoretical and experimental frameworks for understanding the balancing act between the need for protein activity and the cost of protein synthesis, with an initial focus on amino acid biosynthetic enzymes.

We infer past migrations within and across body sites, selective pressures faced by bacteria in vivo, and the molecular strategies used to adapt to these pressures. Crucially, these inferences can be performed without longitudinal studies, because bacterial strains diversify within hosts to form co-existing lineages that preserve a record of their natural history within the host.

This has occurred in part because of the growing realization that many of the major oncogenic driver mutations involved in cancer promote nutrient uptake and anabolic metabolism. Our research has focused on the M2 isoform of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK-M2), which is expressed during embryonic development and at high levels in cancer cells. All tumors and cell lines studied to date express exclusively PK-M2, while normal adult tissues express another isoform of pyruvate kinase. PK-M2 expression is required for aerobic glycolysis. Aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, involves the conversion of glucose into lactate even when oxygen is abundant and is the form of glucose metabolism observed in most cancers. In addition to promoting aerobic glycolysis, PK-M2 appears to be required for human cancer cells to form tumors . . PK-M2 is different from other pyruvate kinase isoforms because it can bind to proteins that are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to cell growth signals.

Ultimately, we seek to understand how imbalanced immune cell communication — due to genetic or environmental variation — results in detrimental host outcomes, including pathogen dissemination, autoimmunity, and tumorigenesis.",https://csbphd.mit.edu/faculty/harikesh-s-wong,Biology,MIT Computational and Systems Biology,,harikesh.wong@nih.gov
Richard A. Young,"The Young laboratory is interested in the transcriptional control of cell identity and differentiation in mice and humans. They use experimental and computational technologies to determine how signaling pathways, transcription factors, chromatin regulators and small RNAs control gene expression programs in healthy and diseased cells.  Their interests range from the basic molecular mechanisms of gene control to development of drugs for cancer and other diseases caused by gene mis-regulation, using a combination of molecular genetic and genomic tools and approaches.",https://csbphd.mit.edu/faculty/richard-young,Biology,MIT Computational and Systems Biology,http://younglab.wi.mit.edu/,young@wi.mit.edu
Bin Zhang,"Understanding genome function is one of the grand scientific challenges of the 21st century. This challenge lies not only in the structural and spatial complexity of the genome’s organization, resulting from the coordinated action of many different components, but also in the dynamical complexity of genome organization, encompassing processes that occur over different time scales, ranging from nanoseconds to hours, to exquisitely regulate the function of the genome. Via developing novel theoretical and computational approaches, the Zhang Lab aims to build a global framework of the human genome that connects its sequence with structure and activity, and to enable quantitative and predictive modeling of genome structure and function.",https://csbphd.mit.edu/faculty/bin-zhang,Chemistry,MIT Computational and Systems Biology,,binz@mit.edu
